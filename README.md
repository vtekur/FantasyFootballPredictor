# FantasyFootballPredictor

Models take a player's statistics from a certain season (including statistics that reflect aging/workload, such as age and number of carries/targets) that are relevant to the player's position as input and predict the player's fantasy points total for the next season as output. Different models were trained for each position, and model averaging was also used when making predictions (the predictions of 20 models were averaged for each position).
